My husband and I usually try to visit a new country every year.
This past year, we were able to find really affordable round-trip tickets to Bali.
We stayed in Uluwatu for the first few days and visited the white sand beaches.
Afterwards, we made our way to the more touristy area of the island.
My favorite experience during this vacation was the bike tour we took into a local village.
This is probably in my top 3 trips I've taken of all time.
